This started as a project for my IT Diploma, but while working on it I decided that it needed to be taken to a fully functional form.
So far all the major functionalities are implemented, but it still has a lot to be done.
I will keep working on it until it is completed, and I welcome all suggestions and commits you may have for the site.
